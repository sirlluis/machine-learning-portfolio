# 👋 Hi, I'm Luis Gerardo Ramírez Archundia

I am a **Physics graduate** from UAEMex (Mexico) with experience in **Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)** and a strong interest in **Machine Learning and Data Science**.  
My projects combine knowledge of physics, mathematics, and programming to solve real-world problems through data-driven approaches.  

My goal is to apply my skills in **data analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning** to innovative projects in the tech and scientific industries.
